Currently working on writing a simpler [help guide for writing wireshark's Lua disector](https://github.com/lukechikkala/Wireshark-Lua-Plugins).<br>

Other projects I'm invested in:
* OpenGL + ImGui
* IP Switcher
* Implementing ONVIF protocol in TouchDesigner for live tracking
* Home Remote Monitoring System
* Better Progress Bars (regardless of language)
* MIDI Tester
